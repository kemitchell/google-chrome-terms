<h2>Google Chrome Terms of Service</h2>
<p>These Terms of Service apply to the executable code version of Google Ch=
rome. Source code for Google Chrome is available free of charge under open =
source software license agreements at chrome://credits.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your relationship with Google</strong></p>
<p>1.1 Your use of Google=E2=80=99s products, software, services and web si=
tes (referred to collectively as the =E2=80=9CServices=E2=80=9D in this doc=
ument and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate=
 written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between yo=
u and Google. =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D means Google Inc., whose principal p=
lace of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, =
United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and set=
s out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with =
Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out =
in this document. These are referred to below as the =E2=80=9CUniversal Ter=
ms=E2=80=9D. Open source software licenses for Google Chrome source code co=
nstitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open s=
ource software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open=
 source licenses govern your agreement with Google for the use of Google Ch=
rome or specific included components of Google Chrome.</p>
<p>1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the terms set forth bel=
ow in the Google Chrome Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal =
Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All=
 of these are referred to below as the =E2=80=9CAdditional Terms=E2=80=9D. =
Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you=
 to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>
<p>1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a lega=
lly binding agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of the=
 Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. C=
ollectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the =E2=80=9CTerm=
s=E2=80=9D.</p>
<p>1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say =
and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take prec=
edence in relation to that Service.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accepting the Terms</strong></p>
<p>2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You=
 may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>
<p>2.2 You can accept the Terms by:</p>
<p>(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made =
available to you by Google in the user interface for any Service; or</p>
<p>(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agr=
ee that Google will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Ter=
ms from that point onwards.</p>
<p><strong>3. Language of the Terms</strong></p>
<p>3.1 Where Google has provided you with a translation of the English lang=
uage version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided =
for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Ter=
ms will govern your relationship with Google.</p>
<p>3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language vers=
ion of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English languag=
e version shall take precedence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Provision of the Services by Google</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the wor=
ld (=E2=80=9CSubsidiaries and Affiliates=E2=80=9D). Sometimes, these compan=
ies will be providing the Services to you on behalf of Google itself. You a=
cknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to p=
rovide the Services to you.</p>
<p>4.2 Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possibl=
e experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nat=
ure of the Services which Google provides may change from time to time with=
out prior notice to you.</p>
<p>4.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree tha=
t Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or a=
ny features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Google=E2=
=80=99s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using th=
e Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Google when =
you stop using the Services.</p>
<p>4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Google disables access to your acc=
ount, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your account detail=
s or any files or other content which is contained in your account.</p>
<p><strong>5. Use of the Services by you</strong></p>
<p>5.1 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted b=
y (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepte=
d practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws=
 regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or =
other relevant countries).</p>
<p>5.2 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes w=
ith or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connect=
ed to the Services).</p>
<p>5.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate a=
greement with Google, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, cop=
y, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.</p>
<p>5.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has n=
o responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your oblig=
ations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or dama=
ge which Google may suffer) of any such breach.</p>
<p><strong>6. Privacy and your personal information</strong></p>
<p>6.1 For information about Google=E2=80=99s data protection practices, pl=
ease read Google=E2=80=99s privacy policy at http://www.google.com/privacy.=

vacy, when you use the Services.</p>
<p>6.2 You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Google=E2=80=99=
s privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>7. Content in the Services</strong></p>
<p>7.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written tex=
t, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, vide=

r use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which=

t, in a separate agreement.</p>
<p>7.3 Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-scre=
en, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from =
any Service. For some of the Services, Google may provide tools to filter o=
ut explicit sexual content. These tools include the SafeSearch preference s=
ettings (see https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510). In addition,=
 there are commercially available services and software to limit access to =
material that you may find objectionable.</p>
<p>7.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Cont=
ent that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in thi=
s respect, you use the Services at your own risk.</p>
<p>7.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has n=
o responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you cre=
ate, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences =
of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by d=
oing so.</p>
<p><strong>8. Proprietary rights</strong></p>
<p>8.1 You acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google=E2=80=99s licensors=

 any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether th=
ose rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those =
rights may exist).</p>
<p>8.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in =
the Terms gives you a right to use any of Google=E2=80=99s trade names, tra=
de marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand f=
eatures.</p>
<p>8.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand f=
eatures in a separate written agreement with Google, then you agree that yo=
ur use of such features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any app=
licable provisions of the Terms, and Google's brand feature use guidelines =
as updated from time to time. These guidelines can be viewed online at http=
://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html (or such other URL as Google =
may provide for this purpose from time to time).</p>
<p>8.4 Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or in=
terest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content =
that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, in=
cluding any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whe=
ther those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world=
 those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with =
Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing tho=
se rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
<p>8.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprieta=
ry rights notices (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be=
 affixed to or contained within the Services.</p>

er of such marks, names or logos.</p>
<p><strong>9. License from Google</strong></p>
<p>9.1 Google gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable=
 and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as=

r other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources.</p>
<p><strong>18. Changes to the Terms</strong></p>
<p>18.1 Google may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms =
from time to time. When these changes are made, Google will make a new copy=
 of the Universal Terms available at http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/e=
ula_text.html and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you fr=
om within, or through, the affected Services.</p>
<p>18.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the dat=
e on which the Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Google wil=
l treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional=
 Terms.</p>
<p><strong>19. General legal terms</strong></p>
<p>19.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in=
 connection with your use of the Services) use a service or download a piec=
e of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or c=
ompany. Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject =
to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, t=
he Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies o=
r individuals.</p>
<p>19.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Goog=
le and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Go=
ogle may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely=
 replace any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Ser=
vices.</p>
<p>19.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those=
 regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the=
 Services.</p>
<p>19.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal rig=
ht or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benef=
it of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiv=
er of Google=E2=80=99s rights and that those rights or remedies will still =
be available to Google.</p>
<p>19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matt=
er, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision=
 will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. Th=
e remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceab=
le.</p>
<p>19.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companie=
s of which Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the T=
erms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, a=
nd rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rig=
hts in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be=
 third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>19.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall=
 be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its c=
onflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive=
 jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, Calif=
ornia to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding t=
his, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive r=
emedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.=
</p>
<p><strong>20.  Additional Terms for Extensions for Google Chrome</strong><=
/p>
<p>20.1  These terms in this section apply if you install extensions on you=
r copy of Google Chrome.  Extensions are small software programs, developed=
 by Google or third parties, that can modify and enhance the functionality =
of Google Chrome. Extensions may have greater privileges to access your bro=
wser or your computer than regular webpages, including the ability to read =
and modify your private data.</p>
<p>20.2  From time to time, Google Chrome may check with remote servers (ho=
sted by Google or by third parties) for available updates to extensions, in=
cluding but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. You agree t=
hat such updates will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed=
 without further notice to you.</p>
<p>20.3  From time to time, Google may discover an extension that violates =
Google developer terms or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or poli=
cies. Google Chrome will periodically download a list of such extensions fr=
om Google=E2=80=99s servers.  You agree that Google may remotely disable or=
 remove any such extension from user systems in its sole discretion. </p>
<p><strong>21. Additional Terms for Enterprise Use</strong></p>
<p>21.1 If you are a business entity, then the individual accepting on beha=
lf of the entity (for the avoidance of doubt, for business entities, in the=
se Terms, "you" means the entity) represents and warrants that he or she ha=
s the authority to act on your behalf, that you represent that you are duly=
 authorized to do business in the country or countries where you operate, a=
nd that your employees, officers, representatives, and other agents accessi=
ng the Service are duly authorized to access Google Chrome and to legally b=
ind you to these Terms.</p>
<p>21.2 Subject to the Terms, and in addition to the license grant in Secti=
on 9, Google grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to reprod=
uce, distribute, install, and use Google Chrome solely on machines intended=
 for use by your employees, officers, representatives, and agents in connec=
tion with your business entity, and provided that their use of Google Chrom=
e will be subject to the Terms.</p>
